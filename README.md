- 👋 Hi, I’m @MahxNotes
- 👀 I’m interested in the user interface design for productivity apps,(focusing on text editors and other writing apps), specifically in differences in the interplay of cognitive learning styes with differernt user interface designs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to better assess the usability and value of different productivity apps and the smoothness and efficiency of their user interfaces by exploring the different aspects of the interplay of cognitive learning styles. I do this through the use of a given model that considers the orientation that a user as a learner cognitively prefers to bring to a new expereintial learning challenge, as well as the organizational style they cognitively prefer to use for processing the challenge itself.
- 💞️ I will be looking to collaborate in the near future through the collection of user provided accounts of their experiences with given productivity apps, as learners engaging with the user interface of the apps. I am interested in accounts both in the initial engagement of user/learner with an app and in the long term experience with an app and how it works well and doesn't work well to meet their cognitive and learning style needs.
- 📫 How to reach me ... If you are interested in this project, you can follow the building of the template and conceptual framework. Once it is built I will post a link through GitHub, through Slack, and/or other means for dialogue and contributions.
